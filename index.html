<h1>Why?</h1>

“Concurrency.” You want more than one thing to happen at once, easily. Really easily. Laugh out loud easily. Also cheaply.

“Supervision.” You know parts of your programs will crash because of random stuff, and you want to restart those parts automatically.

“FP.” Functional programming means you know what all your variables hold and how they got that way. Functional programming also means you can pass instructions around like variables.

     - functions
     - as opposed to what?
     - functions can be passed around

 <h1>Why not?</h1>

Mandatory periods, semi-colons, colons.

Strange.

Erlang mostly lives in the Linux world.

<h1>Getting started.</h1>

$&lt; something something erlang

Go install it. You can do it. You believe in you.

<h1>I’ve got a REPL. What now?</h1>

A REPL (“repple”, like “ripple” with an e instead of an i) is a shell.
Read-Evaluate-Print-Loop

It reads what you’ve typed, like any command line.
It evaluates a complete statement, ending in a period. (Yes, like a sentence.)
It prints out the result. (Everything has a result.)
It loops back to reading what you’ve typed.

<h1>What to type?</h1>

Statements.
Here are some to get us started.

1.
This is an integer. A whole number.

1 + 1.
This is addition.

1.0.
This is a decimal number.

“I believe in myself.”.
This is a list of numbers. It is a string. It is both.

a.
This is an atom. It is a constant with a value of a. What can you do with that? You might be surprised.

‘a’.
This is an atom. It _looks_ like a string. It is not.

&lt;&lt;“binary””&gt;&gt;.
This is a string, in binary. Actual bytes. Actual bits.

[this, “is”, a, &lt;&lt;“list”&gt;&gt;, of, 7, “elements”].
Lists can have different types of stuff.

[]
Lists can be empty.

{“this”, is, ‘a’, &lt;&lt;“tuple”&gt;&gt; with, 7, elements}.
Tuples can have different types of stuff.

{}
Tuples can be empty.

{[{[]}]}
Tuple of list of tuple of empty list.

TheThing = 1.
TheThing is a “variable.” It will never more vary. Eh?

<h1>Making logic.</h1>

1 &gt; 0.
true

“I” &gt; you.
true

1.0 &gt; 1.
false

<h1>What if ...</h1>

if 1 &gt; 0 -&gt; yes; true -&gt; no.
yes

Wait, what?
The arrow, “-&gt; basically means “then”, the semi-colon means “else if”.
This reads as “If one is greater than zero, then do ‘yes’; otherwise if true then do ‘no’."
Wait, do?
Everything you do in Erlang has a value. The last thing you do in a sequence of things is the value of that sequence of things.

1, 2, 3, 4, 5.
5

if 1 &gt; 0 -&gt; 1, 2, 3, 4, 5; 1 = 1 -&gt; no.

What happens to 1, 2, 3 and 4? Nothing. You “did” them, which for numbers means doing nothing.

What about the “true -&gt; no.” part?
The “if” statement always has to have a branch that works. The if will always return the result of whatever clause worked.

<h1>In the case of ...</h1>

case 1 of 2 -&gt; yes; _ -&gt; no end.

Yup, a lot like the “if” statement. Same deal, but the case statement is more forgiving. “if” only lets you have a strict set of tests but case lets you use any expression.

<h1>Functions.</h1>

fun() -&gt; 1 end.

Takes no arguments, returns 1. The end.

fun(1) -&gt; 1 end.
Takes one argument, which must be the literal number 1 and returns 1.

fun(X) -&gt; 1 end.
Takes an argument, which we ignore, and returns 1.

fun(X) when X == 1 -&gt; 1 end.
Takes an argument, which we make sure is 1, and returns 1.

fun(X) when X &gt; 0 -&gt; positive;
     (X) when X &lt; 0 -&gt; negative;
     (0) -&gt; zero.
Three different “clauses” in one function that each “match” a different argument.
The “when” part is called a “guard”. “if” statements only use guards.

<h1>Matchmaker, Matchmaker make me a match!</h1>

A.
* 1: variable ‘A’ is unbound.
Oh, so we have to “bind” variables.

A = 1.
Ah, so we assign a value.
NO! Bad!
We “match” the two values.
But A is “unbound”. How does it match 1?
Unbound variables are promiscuous. They will bind to the first thing they are matched with.
Okay fine, we assigned 1 to A, but we did it by matching.

A = 2.
** exception error: no match of right hand side value 2
What happened?
A is no longer unbound. A is bound to 1.
We tried to match A, which is 1, with 2, … which is 2.

A = 1.
1
Yup. A is 1. The value of the expression matching A to 1 is also 1.

{A, B} = {1, 2}.
{1, 2}.
A
1.
B
2.

We matched a tuple of two values to a tuple of two variables.
A matched 1, because A is already 1.
B was unbound, so B matched 2 and is now bound to 2.
The result of the match is returned.

{X, [Y, {Z, 4}, “bob”], &lt;&lt;“Frank”&gt;&gt; 10, []} = {1, [b, {“Wham”, 4}, “bob”], &lt;&lt;“Frank”&gt;&gt; 10, []}.
{1, [b, {“Wham”, 4}, “bob”], &lt;&lt;“Frank”&gt;&gt;, 10, []}
Woah.
Yup, we just picked X, Y and Z out of a lineup of data.
We “deconstructed” the frankendata to “pull out” some values.

X.
1
Y.
b
Z.
“Wham"
